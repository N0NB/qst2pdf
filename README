qst2pdf.pl -- a script to process the QST View .tif files 
into one PDF per issue

What is it?
===========

qst2pdf.pl -- a script to convert the .tif files found on the QST VIEW CD 
set(s) into a convenient cross-platform PDF (Portable Document Format) file.  
The resulting PDF contains one complete issue of QST and can be viewed with 
any PDF reader (Gnome Document Reader, Okular, Xpdf, Acrobat Reader, gv, etc.

Prerequisites
=============

You will need the following programs (Debian package names are listed):
	Perl (5.10 tested) -- perl (perl),
	Ghostscript -- ps2pdf (gscommon),
	Tiff tools -- tiff2ps (libtiff-tools),
	PS Utils -- epsffit (psutils),
	100 to 300 MB of free disk space per issue,
	ability to mount the QST View CD (later distributions do this automatically),
	Perl-doc to view the embedded manual page (--man switch).

While the resulting PDF isn't too big (equivalent to the size of an issue's TIFF
files combined), the temporary PS files are huge.  For example, to convert the
January 1930 issue approximately 200 MB of temporary file space was needed.  
Later issues will undoubtedly need more space.

Installation
============

If you have ~/bin in your path you can put the qst2pdf.pl script there or
else /usr/local/bin should work as well.  You may wish to make the script
executable, e.g. chmod +x ~/bin/qst2pdf.pl

Invocation
==========

If you made the script executable, just typing qst2pdf.pl at the command
prompt will get things rolling.  Otherwise you will need to invoke perl
and give it the path to the script like so:
	perl ~/bin/qst2pdf.pl

Usage
=====

The script only works in batch mode by default and interactive mode when passed
the --single option.  In batch mode, the script prompts for confirmation of the
mount point of the CDROM and then the output directory.  The CDROM is processed
for each year and issue and once all years have been processed the script exits.

In interactive mode, CDROM mount point and output directory are confirmed and
the script will prompt with default values for year and month.  Entering a new
string will replace the prompted value while pressing <Enter> with no value
will cause the default to be accepted.

By default the script assumes the CD is mounted under /media with the CDROM
name as the mount point.  As a fallback, the script will try /cdrom.  The output
will be in the current working directory.  You may want to create a new
directory for the PDFs to be written to, ~/qst works well (if you have the 
space.  I use a separate partition mounted as /opt and put my QST files there).

The script will read the directory structure of the QST View CD and will
process all files in batch mode, the default.  Interactive mode will prompt
you for which year and month to process.  Once a given month has been 
processed the script will prompt for another month in that year.  If a 
selection is not made for the month, the script will prompt for another
year and the months in that year can be processed.  

Not selecting a month or year will cause the script to exit.

The output directory structure is one directory for each year under the current
working directory and all issues are individual PDF files in that directory.
Year directories are four digits and output files are named as YYYY-MM.pdf.

PDF makes viewing each issue convenient and portable.  I will leave it up to
you to understand and comply with copyright law regarding the QST content.

Bugs
====

The following issues are known at this time.

	o	Write permissions are not checked and the script simply
		fails if it cannot write a file.

	o	The script will simply die if one of the dependent helper
		programs cannot be found.

	o	Selections (CD mount point, output directory, etc) are
		not saved between sessions.

	o	This script is probably considered insecure since it
		doesn't check for a file's existence and will overwrite
		any file that previously exists.

Please report any other issues, patches, suggestions, etc to Nate Bargmann,

Have fun!
