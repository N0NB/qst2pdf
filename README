qst2pdf.pl -- a script to process the QST View .tif files 
into one PDF per issue

What is it?
===========

qst2pdf -- an interactive script to convert the .tif files found on the
QST VIEW CD set(s) into a convenient cross-platform PDF (Portable Document
Format) file.  The resulting PDF contains one complete issue of QST and
can be viewed with Xpdf, Acrobat Reader, gv, etc.

Prerequisites
=============

You will need the following programs (Debian package names are listed):
	Perl -- perl (perl),
	Ghostscript -- ps2pdf (gscommon),
	Tiff tools -- tiff2ps (libtiff-tools),
	PS Utils -- epsffit (psutils),
	100 to 300 MB of free disk space,
	ability to mount the QST View CD.

While the resulting PDF isn't too big, the temprary PS files are huge.
For example, to convert the January 1930 issue approximately 200 MB of 
temporary file space was needed.  Later issues will undoubtedly need 
more space.

Installation
============

If you have ~/bin in your path you can put the qst2pdf.pl script there or
else /usr/local/bin should work as well.  You may wish to make the script
executable, e.g. chmod +x ~/bin/qst2pdf.pl

Invocation
==========

If you made the script executable, just typing qst2pdf.pl at the command
prompt will get things rolling.  Otherwise you will need to invoke perl
and give it the path to the script like so:
	perl ~/bin/qst2pdf.pl
	
Usage
=====

The script only works in interactive mode and will prompt with default
values for some entries.  Entering a new string will replace the prompted 
value while pressing <Enter> will cause the default to be accepted.

By default the script assumes the CD is mounted on /cdrom and the output
will be in the current working directory.  You may want to create a new
directory for the PDFs to be written to, ~/qst works well.

The script will read the directory structure of the QST View CD and will
prompt you for which year and month to process.  Once a given month has
been processed the script will prompt for another month in that year.  
If a selection is not made for the month, the script will prompt for another
year and the months in that year can be processed.  

Not selecting a month or year will cause the script to exit.

The output directory structure mirrors that of the source CD.  I have 
burned the output directory to CD so I now have a portable and convenient
way to view the old QSTs elsewhere.  I will leave it up to you to understand
and comply with copyright law regarding the QST content.

Bugs
====

The following issues are known at this time.

	o	Write permissions are not checked and the script simply
		fails if it cannot write a file.
	
	o	The script will simply die if one of the dependent helper
		programs cannot be found.
		
	o	Selections (CD mount point, output directory, etc) are
		not saved between sessions.
		
	o	This script is probably considered insecure since it
		doesn't check for a file's existence and will overwrite
		any file that previously exists.
		
Please report any other issues, patches, suggestions, etc to Nate Bargmann,

Have fun!
